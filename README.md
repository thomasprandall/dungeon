# .dungon//remastered SRD + Avatar Manager based on Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```
# Another Random Project
One of the most reliable things to light a spark of development interest for me is a new TTRPG coming into my grasp.

I set aside a project I am working on for Mothership to focus on this reference site and character creator for the recently released .dungeon//remastered by Snow.

I chose Astro for this project because I love how quickly I can get a static site up and out there but still maintain flexibility to add features over time.

Long term this project will likely include some React but for now it is all astro and vanilla JS.

I have utilized (and made some modifications to) the tremendous work of Sakun Archarige, the author of System.css and their usage of the Chicago 12pt and Geneva 9pt fonts by @blogmywiki (twitter).

I will add more information here when the project is complete, hopefully.
